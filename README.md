# PayQR

## Introduction

In light of the outbreak of the Corona pandemic which aggravated the **cash liquidity crisis** in banking agencies and post offices of Algeria, the withdraw of money has become a problem for the citizens because they have to wait in lines for hours to get it.

The underuse of the **electronic payment** and the high demand of tangible money are the most two factors causing the cash liquidity crisis. So it has become necessary to educate people and direct them to use the e-payment. To solve this, we have developed a mobile application using flutter, that would improve the cash flow by using payment cards.
